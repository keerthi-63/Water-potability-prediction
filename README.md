# Water-potability-prediction
Machine learning algorithms were used to construct a water potability prediction in this project. The Ph value, conductivity,hardness,and other factors are used in this method in this method to determine whether the water is safe to drink or not.

Dataset : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/adityakadiwal/water-potability

## Deployment

StreamLit - Open source framework that helps in creating web apps for data science and machine learning

Model - The ipynb file used for build, train and testing the model





## Documentation

IMPORTING THE DATASET 

The dataset including the parameters was taken from kaggle and imported into python jupyter notebook.

DATA PREPROSESSING

1.Handling Missing Data

Considering the existence of missing data values, the median imputation has been applied to the approach.

2.Outlier Analysis

The outliers have been identified and have been capped to their respective maximum and minimum bounds with the IQR implementation.

3.Exploratory Data Analysis

The data has been thoroughly analysed and multiple graphs have been visualized in association with the parameters considered. 

MODEL BUILDING AND PREDICTION

The machine learning model built in this project uses Decision Tree classifier, Random Forest Classifier and XGB Classifier.

To find the enhanced performance resulting model parameters, the hyperparameteric tuning was used in the approach.
